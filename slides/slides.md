## Who will enter the **kingdom of God**?

******
[22](# "ref")
He went on his way through towns and villages, <br>
teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem.

[23](# "ref")
And someone said to him, <br>
“Lord, will those who are saved be few?”

And he said to them, <br>
[24](# "ref")
“Strive to enter through the narrow door. <br>
For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

******
[25](# "ref")
When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, <br>
and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, <br>
saying, ‘Lord, open to us,’ <br>
then he will answer you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’

[26](# "ref")
Then you will begin to say, <br>
‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’

[27](# "ref")
But he will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from. <br>
Depart from me, all you workers of evil!’

******
[28](# "ref")
In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, <br>
when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob <br>
and all the prophets in the kingdom of God <br>
but you yourselves cast out.

[29](# "ref")
And people will come from east and west, <br>
and from north and south, <br>
and recline at table in the kingdom of God.

[30](# "ref")
And behold, some are last who will be first, <br>
and some are first who will be last.”
